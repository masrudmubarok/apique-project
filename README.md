# Fullstack Task Management Project (Apique Project)

This project is divided into three main components, each focusing on a different platform and technology stack:

---

## 🖥️ Backend API (PHP/Laravel)

Develop a RESTful service that manages a collection of tasks. The service should support:

- Creating new entries  
- Retrieving a full list of tasks  
- Updating individual items  
- Deleting specific records  

---

## 🌐 Web Client (Next.js)

Build a web-based user interface using **Next.js** that communicates with the backend API. The application should:

- Build a frontend interface using Next.js.
- Fetch and display tasks from the API.
- Use Axios or React Query for handling API requests.
- Interface can be kept simple; TailwindCSS or Bootstrap may be used optionally for styling.

---

## 📱 Mobile Application (Flutter)

Create a mobile front-end using **Flutter**. The application should:

- Create a mobile interface with Flutter.
- Display tasks from the API using ListView.builder().
- Allow users to create and update tasks.
- Use the Dio package for making HTTP requests.
- Keep the UI clean and minimal to focus on essential functionality.

### 📁 Note

Each application has its own setup instructions inside its respective folder.  
**Please open the appropriate folder (`backend-laravel`, `frontend-next`, `mobile-flutter`) and read the README file inside for detailed setup instructions.**
